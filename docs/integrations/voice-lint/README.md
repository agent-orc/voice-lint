# Voice Lint dossier integration

This integration maintains the product section of dossier **VL-W1** in
[`docs/operations/voice-concept-revision/`](../../operations/voice-concept-revision/)
within this Voice Lint repository. Studio and the libraries do not load the dossier
at runtime.

- `dossier-fragment.html` is the maintained implementation/evidence narrative.
- `dossier.json` declares the target identity, public title, status text and summary.
- The dossier directory retains the full document and its lifecycle fields.

From the Voice Lint repository root:

```sh
# Compare only. Exit 1 means that an explicit synchronization is needed.
npm run docs:dossier:check -- --repository .

# Synchronize the marked section and declared presentation fields.
npm run docs:dossier:sync -- --repository .

# Read the actually served dossier and check desktop/mobile layout.
npm run test:dossier
```

`VOICE_LINT_REPOSITORY` can supply the target path. No machine-specific path is
compiled into the tool. `--content-only` preserves the descriptor while updating
the marked HTML section. Repeat synchronization makes no changes when the
maintained content is already current.

The synchronizer requires the existing `voice-concept-revision` / `VL-W1`
identity and unique section markers. It preserves status, phase, related task
keys and all unrelated fields. It never commits, pushes or changes companion
concept files. Missing markers or identity mismatch fail before writing. This
tool updates the checked-out dossier files; it must not be pointed at centrally
managed application metadata.

The read-only verifier accepts `--api-base`, `--client-id`, `--project`, `--output`
and `--skip-browser`. It checks the maintained content, not hardcoded historical
test counts or Git commits. Its default API is the existing local Agent Studio
reference service; it does not start that service or mutate its data.

## Separate application and documentation launch entries

The local project sidebar exposes two explicit, startable entries. Both commands
run at the Voice Lint repository root; the project host stores the resolved
local working directory. The Studio application and the public documentation
preview are separate processes and pages.

| Label | Start command | Local page |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Voice Studio öffnen | `npm start` | `http://127.0.0.1:5188/` |
| Website und Doku öffnen | `npm run website:preview` | `http://127.0.0.1:5187/voice/` |

The latter opens the Library/UI homepage, examples and HTML technical guides.
Starting Studio alone does not open that product website. Local project/URL IDs
are host metadata; they are not a portable product API or a deployment target.
